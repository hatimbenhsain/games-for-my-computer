<<HideBoxLetter TaskManager>>

Nour: Those descriptions don't seem very helpful. But I appreciate their artistry!

        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        Nour: Huh?! You're an alien!
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
        Alien: Maybe to you... why are you going around scanning people?
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        Nour: I'm sorry that's what I thought I was supposed to do... why are you hiding?
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
        Alien: I'm having trouble being myself. 
        Alien: We came here to see your planet's beautiful art.
        Alien: But we crashed and then got a little overwhelmed and unsure about ourselves. 
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        Nour: We? Are there more of you? 
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
        Alien: Yeah we all came here together...
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        Nour: Why are you unsure of yourself?
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
        Alien: I love art... I love beauty... I love love... 
        Alien: I'm worried I'll never be able to contribute to any of it...
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        -> I feel like everyone feels like that sometimes.
            Nour: I feel like everyone feels like that sometimes.
            <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
            Alien: You think so?
            <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
            Nour: Yeah I think it's so valid to be overwhelmed by the bigness of the universe and urge to create beauty! 
        -> Of course you will. You're alive! 
            Nour: Of course you will. You're alive! You can't help but effect the universe around you.
            <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>> 
            Alien: Really?
            <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
            Nour: Totally, look at you you're livening up this dusty old museum and brightening my day.
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
        Alien: ...
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        Nour: Hello? Alien?
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
        <<Animate AlienPainting01 AlienAppear>>
        Alien: I... I really needed to hear that... thank you.
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        Nour: Of course... Sorry again for scanning you. 
        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
        Alien: That's ok but get rid of that thing... just talk to us.

        <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
        Nour: I love museums! I'll take a look around.

<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
Nour: Is that a good ahhhhhhhhh or a bad ahhhhhhhhh?
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
Alien: I’m not sure. I’m feeling pretty unsure right now.
Alien: After our space ship crashed we all decided to try being art for a while. 
Alien: But it feels very vulnerable! 
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
Nour: I think that you’re very beautiful!
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
Alien: We don’t care about things like beauty…
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
Nour: Then what do you care about?
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
Alien: I care about people…I want them to witness me…and find meaning.
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
-> I find so much meaning in your...
    Nour: I find so much meaning in your panicked face and curves.
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
    Alien: My aesthetic choice to include many curved lines speaks to the very nature of fear.
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
    Nour: Wow, your analysis is bringing even more depth to my interpretation.  
-> Your presence brings so much meaning to...
    Nour: Your presence brings so much meaning to everyone who has freaked out ever.
    Nour: Today I have lost my cool so many times.
    Nour: Like when I found out my crush already has a partner or when my legs transformed into tentacles or when I had to do surgery...
    Nour: But seeing you here in a static state of panic makes me feel less alone.
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>> 
    Alien: And that makes you feel better?
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
    Nour: It so does.
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
<<Animate AlienPainting02 ScreamPaintingDance>>
Alien: ~Thank you~
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
Nour: That conversation felt so much deeper than just complimenting…It feels good to affirm!

<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
Alien: It’s art made of manufactured objects.
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
Nour: Hmmm...
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
Alien: I know!!!!
Alien: It makes no sense and I love it...I think??
Alien: Am I even allowed to say I love it??
Alien: Because intellectually I do not understand!
Alien: How can a sink be a piece of art????
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
-> There is so much beauty in...
    Nour: There is so much beauty in all of these questions and unknowns.
    Nour: Maybe the artistry is in the questions themselves!
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
-> Your love for this type of art is...
    Nour: Your love for this type of art is so valid and felt by many.
    Nour: Art is just something someone made one time.
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>> 
    Alien: That's so easy to forget when tons of people have written academic papers on it.
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
    Nour: The love the people writing those papers have is just as valid as yours.
    Nour: You don't need to understand things to love them. 
    <<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
    Alien: I’ve never thought of it that way before.
Alien: I’ve never thought of it that way before.
Alien: Wow I…
Alien: I feel free in my nonsensical love.

<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>

<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>

Alien: I don’t have it in me right now…
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
-> It's totally okay to feel that way. 
    Nour: It's totally okay to feel that way. You were able to keep your friends safe in a stressful moment.
-> You endured fireballs!
    Nour: You endured fireballs! It's so valid to feel a little burnt out.
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>

<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
Nour: I do!
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
Alien: But I’ve trapped us in here!
Alien: And we’re ruining the museum!!!!
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem default>>
Nour: Honestly, this is the best time I’ve ever had at this museum.
Nour: The highlight of my Middle School's field trip here was when someone licked a painting. 
Nour: This was so much better than that! 
Nour: No one ever comes here anymore, so they’ve stopped putting together new exhibits.
Nour: I bet if they did one featuring all of you, that could completely turn things around!
<<ChangeLineView DialogueSystem alien>>
Alien: You really think people would come to see us?
